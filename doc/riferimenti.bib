  abstract = "In Computed Tomography (CT), decreasing the X-rays dose is essential to reduce the negative effects of radiation
  exposure on the human health. One possible way to accomplish it is to reduce the number of projections acquired, hence the name
  of sparse CT. Traditional methods for image reconstruction cannot recover reliable images in this case: the lack of information
  due to the missed projections produces strong artifacts. Alternatively, optimization frameworks are flexible models where
  incorporated regularization functions impose regularity constraints on the solution, thus avoiding unwanted artifacts and
  contrasting noise propagation. Since the iterative methods solving the optimization problem calculate more accurate solutions as
  iterations (and computational time) increase, it is possible to choose a better reconstructed image at the expense of execution
  time, or viceversa. Parallel implementations of the iterative solvers significantly reduce the computational time, allowing for
  a large number of iterations in a prefixed short time.",

  abstract = {Ready availability has prompted the use of computed tomography (CT) data in various applications in radiation
  therapy. For example, some radiation treatment planning systems now utilize CT data in heterogeneous dose calculation
  algorithms. In radiotherapy imaging applications, CT data are projected onto specified planes, thus producing “radiographs,”
  which are compared with simulator radiographs to assist in proper patient positioning and delineation of target volumes.
  All these applications share the common geometric problem of evaluating the radiological path through the CT array.
  Due to the complexity of the three-dimensional geometry and the enormous amount of CT data, the exact evaluation of the
  radiological path has proven to be a time consuming and difficult problem.
  This paper identifies the inefficient aspect of the traditional exact evaluation of the radiological path as that of treating
  the CT data as individual voxels. Rather than individual voxels, a new exact algorithm is presented that considers the CT data
  as consisting of the intersection volumes of three orthogonal sets of equally spaced, parallel planes. For a three-dimensional
  CT array of N3 voxels, the new exact algorithm scales with 3N, the number of planes, rather than N3, the number of voxels.
  Coded in fortran-77 on a VAX 11/780 with a floating point option, the algorithm requires approximately 5 ms to calculate an
  average radiological path in a 1003 voxel array.},
